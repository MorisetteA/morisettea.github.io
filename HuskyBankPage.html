                <p>HuskyBank is your financial companion to prepare you for the “real world”. Starting college is already a hard transition to go through, being in debt makes it harder. HuskyBank presents students the opportunity to play with the idea of budgeting. As they play, students learn the tools they need to manage finances responsibly in a less-intimidating and interactive experience.</p>

            <div style="width: 460px;">
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Problem</p>
                <p>As university students try to manage their school work, jobs, and social lives, there is a tendency to forget how to properly manage their money. The financial stress accumulates and puts a greater mental strain on the students, negatively affecting the overall well-being of the students.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 40px;">Interviews</h2>
        <p>To gain a greater insight into what university students are experiencing regarding financial difficulties and budgeting app background, we decided to conduct interviews with university students. The responses we were most interested in was what the students look for in a budgeting app. The responses mainly focused on:</p>

        <p>With the new information we received, we began to form the outline for who our audience was. We ended up splitting the audience into 3 main personas. The 3 personas ranged from our optimal target audience to our least targeted audience. I created our optimal target persona "Samantha" intending to describe her as the typical student who was in a financial struggle with the hopes of getting more organized.</p>

        <p>This was our user flow map when the idea of the app was first being developed. It includes a lot of pathways that did have to be omitted in the final product because we needed to have more reasonable deliverables that we could achieve by our deadline. The pathways are still left in the user flow map because they are future ideas that we may want to incorporate later on.</p>

    <div class="InfoParas">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 40px;">Husky Avatar</h2>
        <p>We wanted our budgeting app to stand out from the other available budgeting apps. To do this, we came up with the idea of having an avatar for the user to interact with when using the app. We wanted an avatar who could be viewed as a friend that encourages the user. With that in mind, a cute Husky dog that acted as the student's financial companion was chosen to be the avatar. The Husky dog breed was chosen to be the avatar specifically because that breed is the mascot of the University of Washington, and our app is catered towards the University of Washington students. To make the app more appealing, we decided to design the Husky in a cartoonish style.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 40px;">Current Prototype Iteration</h2>
        <p>The main changes made from our high-fidelity wireframe was having the background color be more subtle and have the vibrant colors be accents. We decided to separate the information with rounded squares to avoid having a block of information that could overwhelm the user. Adding the gray paw prints in the background was another decision we made to fill in the white space and, in turn, making the app look playful.</p>

    <div class="InfoParas">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 40px;">Lessons + Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>This project was my first project where the teammates all had various skills. There was an even split between the coders and the artists, and with this came some challenges in understanding what was most important in the development process and what needed the bulk of our attention. Overcoming these challenges took a bit of time as we had to learn one another's limits.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 90px";>When the idea was first created, our final goal was to have a functional app to be used by the students of the University of Washington. That is still our goal. Our next step is to do a final redesign of the application and pitch the idea to the University.</p>
