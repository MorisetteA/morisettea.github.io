                <p>All Possible Futures is the capstone theme for the 2020 seniors in the Interactive Media Design program. During my junior year in the program, I took part in designing the website to showcase the capstone projects. This year is the first year that the IMD Bothell Capstone website will be a joint website that will archive past capstone projects.</p>

            <p>The seniors came up with a list of some components they wanted to have on the homepage.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“What is IMD” Section where we explain the major itself and its goals</li>
                    <li>“What is the Capstone Exhibit” Section. This section should explain our capstone theme (All Possible Futures)</li>
                    <li>Links to project pages / short description or preview of project</li>
                    <li>Link to archive of older capstones (not as relevant as this is the first year for a joint site)</li>
                    <li>Some sort of title banner with logo for the current year’s capstone</li>
                    <li>A footer of some sort that will credit everyone who helped on this project</li>
                </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="List">
            <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The seniors wanted to figure out how they should organize the website to showcase all of the capstone projects. So there needed to be an exploration on websites that have the same purpose display multiple academic projects. The final 3 websites are ones that present various student projects from the institutions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://uwbimd2019.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UWB IMD Website of 2019</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://seattlecentralcreativeacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Central Creative Academy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://art.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Art + Art History + Design</a></li>

    <!---------------------------------- Start User Case -------------------------------------->
    
    <div class="InfoParas">
        <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">User Cases</h3>
        <p>Originally creating these user cases, the target audience was for those visiting the website and the physical exhibition. However, the capstone exhibition was canceled and the user cases were changed to only focus on how the website itself and who will use it. These cases weren't split into which user will be a priority but rather of the possible audience that might appear.</p>

        <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">Reflection</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 90px;">The main takeaway from this project was flexibility. This project happened amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, so there was a major shift in the way we had to work together to complete this website. Working remotely, having virtual meetings, and communicating more often due to separation: these changes were drastic. They forced me to be as flexible as possible with a situation that we couldn't control. I had to adjust my schedule and planning to align with the pace of other groups who contributed to the website. Some problems had to be fixed quickly, but it was imperative that the solutions to these problems still maintained upstanding quality.</p>
